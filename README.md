| 2. Basic Gameplay | During the game, colored balls appear from random areas of the screen and the goal of the game is to click balls that spawn to create musical notes
while clicking the black balls that spawn playing disonance to prevent disinnance from ruining the music. |
| 3. Sound & Effects | There will be sound effects a bed of ambience in the background, balls when clicked produce a single note from a scale and particle effects of some kind to indicate a click. [optional] There will also be special balls that when clicked play chords |
| 4. Gameplay Mechanics | As the game progresses, colored balls spawn, player clicks them to generate tones, making it sound like a piece of music is being made, while gathering points [optional] There will also be black balls that spawn automatically playing dissonance, player should click to stop |
| 5. User Interface | The score will increase whenever balls are clicked . At the start of the game, the title SOUND OFF will appear and the game will end when 1 minute mark has lapsed |
